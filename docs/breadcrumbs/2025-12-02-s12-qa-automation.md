# Breadcrumb
- **Task asked:** S12: Automated QA & release readiness (Asana `1212222478683368`)
- **Plan:** Stand up a scripted QA smoke that builds/installs the ZIP in Docker, seeds demo data, and exercises board load, stage move + notifications log/resend, and stats exports; add the missing Asana ritual guide and release checklist updates across runbooks.
- **Files changed:** docs/ASANA_TOOLBOX.md (new), scripts/qa_smoke.sh (new), AGENTS.md, TECH_READINESS.md, QA_TOOLBELT.md, docs/DEBT.md, docs/README.md, docs/REFACTOR_LOG.md, qa/QA_LOG.md, this breadcrumb (assets/build artifacts regenerated during smoke run).
- **Commands executed:** `ocasana tasks comment/update/move` to lock task `1212222478683368` (GF Status → In progress, section → Doing); `git checkout -b refactor/s12-qa-automation`; `bash scripts/qa_smoke.sh` (initial runs failed on heredoc/args) → `SKIP_ASSET_BUILD=1 bash scripts/qa_smoke.sh`; manual admin happy-path via WP-CLI updates (Clients→Settings) → `/opt/qa/artifacts/manual-admin-happy-path-20251202T193829.txt`.
- **Tests & results:** `bash scripts/qa_smoke.sh` → `/opt/qa/artifacts/qa-smoke-20251202T193642Z.txt` (PASS; installs ZIP, seeds demo data, PHPCS, board snapshot, stage move to bath with notification log/resend, stats endpoints); `qa-phpcs plugin/bb-groomflow` → `/opt/qa/artifacts/phpcs-1764704214.txt` (PASS); Manual admin happy-path (WP-CLI edits across Clients→Settings) → `/opt/qa/artifacts/manual-admin-happy-path-20251202T193829.txt` (PASS).
- **Tips & Tricks:** `Visit_Service::build_board_payload()` now requires an argument array (view + visibility flags); re-use the pattern in `scripts/qa_smoke.sh` when hitting it via `wp eval`. When using `read -d ''` in bash with `set -e`, append `|| true` so the heredoc EOF doesn’t abort. Skip asset rebuilds during smoke runs with `SKIP_ASSET_BUILD=1`.
- **Remaining work:** Await PM review on Asana; keep branch ready for follow-ups.
