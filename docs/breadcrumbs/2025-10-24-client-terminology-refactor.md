- **Task asked:** Replace “Dog” terminology across the product with “Client”, update admin UI and docs, and keep the plugin build loop green.
- **Plan:** 1) Rename the Dogs admin UI to Clients (menu labels, messages, list table, view template) without breaking existing database tables. 2) Update core docs/specs to reinforce the client-first framing. 3) Rebuild the plugin, reinstall in Docker, and capture any QA notes.
- **Files changed:** README.md; SPEC.md; AGENTS.md; QA_TOOLBELT.md; docs/FRONTEND_BINDINGS.md; docs/ARCHITECTURE.md; docs/UX_GUIDE.md; docs/API.md; docs/DB_SCHEMA.md; docs/ROADMAP.md; docs/workflow.md; docs/sprints/Sprint-0.md; docs/sprints/Sprint-1.md; docs/sprints/Sprint-2.md; docs/sprints/Sprint-3.md; docs/sprints/Sprint-4.md; docs/sprints/Sprint-5.md; docs/breadcrumbs/2025-10-22-handoff.md; docs/breadcrumbs/2025-10-22-dogs-admin.md; docs/breadcrumbs/2025-10-22-codex.md; plugin/bb-groomflow/bb-groomflow.php; plugin/bb-groomflow/includes/class-plugin.php; plugin/bb-groomflow/includes/admin/class-clients-admin.php (renamed from class-dogs-admin.php); plugin/bb-groomflow/includes/admin/class-clients-list-table.php (renamed from class-dogs-list-table.php); plugin/bb-groomflow/includes/admin/views/clients-page.php (renamed from dogs-page.php); plugin/bb-groomflow/includes/admin/views/settings-page.php; plugin/bb-groomflow/includes/elementor/class-board-widget.php.
- **Commands executed:** bash scripts/build_plugin_zip.sh; docker compose cp ../build/bb-groomflow-0.1.0-dev.zip wordpress:/var/www/html/bb-groomflow-0.1.0-dev.zip; docker compose run --rm -T wpcli wp plugin install /var/www/html/bb-groomflow-0.1.0-dev.zip --force --activate; docker compose run --rm -T wpcli wp eval '...' (menu inspection attempt — failed due to WP admin bootstrap requirements); docker compose run --rm -T wpcli wp eval '...' (direct insert attempt — failed because plugin bootstrap not loaded); php -l on class-clients-admin.php, class-clients-list-table.php, clients-page.php, class-plugin.php.
- **Tests & results:** Syntax checks pass for updated PHP files; plugin ZIP rebuilds and reinstalls cleanly in Docker. WP-CLI attempts to list admin submenu slugs and programmatically insert a client record failed (expected due to admin menu globals and plugin bootstrap not fully loaded in eval context). Manual happy-path form checks still required via browser.
- **Tips & Tricks:** When deprecating an admin slug, register the legacy slug with `add_submenu_page( null, ... )` so old bookmarks keep working while the menu label switches to the new term.
- **Remaining work:** Run full in-browser QA for the Clients, Guardians, Services, Packages, Flags, Views, and Settings forms to confirm values persist in edit mode; plan the eventual database/REST rename from `dogs` → `clients`.
