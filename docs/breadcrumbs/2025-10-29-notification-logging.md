# Breadcrumb
- **Task asked:** Extend stage-triggered notifications with delivery logging and polish the admin UX so future agents can audit messages easily.
- **Plan:** Audit existing send flow → add notification log table + persistence → surface documentation updates → run PHPCS/build/install → note QA artifacts.
- **Files changed:** plugin/bb-groomflow/includes/database/class-schema.php; plugin/bb-groomflow/bb-groomflow.php; plugin/bb-groomflow/includes/notifications/class-notifications-service.php; plugin/bb-groomflow/assets/css/admin.css; plugin/bb-groomflow/includes/admin/views/notifications-page.php; plugin/bb-groomflow/assets/js/admin.js; plugin/bb-groomflow/includes/admin/class-notification-logs-admin.php; plugin/bb-groomflow/includes/admin/class-notification-logs-list-table.php; plugin/bb-groomflow/includes/admin/views/notification-logs-page.php; docs/DB_SCHEMA.md; SPEC.md; docs/API.md; CHANGELOG.md
- **Commands executed:** `npm run build`; `bash scripts/build_plugin_zip.sh`; `docker compose run --rm -T wpcli sh -c "cat > /tmp/bbgf.zip && wp plugin install /tmp/bbgf.zip --force --activate" < ../build/bb-groomflow-0.1.0-dev.zip`; `qa-phpcs plugin/bb-groomflow` → `/opt/qa/artifacts/phpcs-1761768509.txt`
- **Tests & results:** Manual smoke via WP-CLI install to ensure schema migrates cleanly; PHPCS passes aside from expected schema-change warnings. Verified Notification Activity filters (search + date range + stage/status/template) return expected rows after seeding sample logs.
- **Tips & Tricks:** When adding new tables, bump `BBGF_DB_VERSION` so `dbDelta` runs automatically; `Schema::TABLE_MAP` drives table lookups across the plugin. Use the new `notification_logs` table for any downstream reporting/queue retry work.
- **Remaining work:** Consider adding export/resend actions from the logs view and capturing async retry hooks for failed deliveries.
