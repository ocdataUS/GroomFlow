# Breadcrumb
- **Task asked:** Extend Sprint 1 CRUD to make Services/Packages/Views admin screens easier to manage (search, better summaries) while keeping lint clean.
- **Plan:** 1) Review existing list tables to spot usability gaps. 2) Add server-side search + richer list output (service chips, view filters) and surface search boxes in each screen. 3) Rebuild the plugin, reinstall into Docker WP, sanity-check via curl + PHPCS, and spot check CRUD paths.
- **Files changed:** plugin/bb-groomflow/includes/admin/class-services-list-table.php; plugin/bb-groomflow/includes/admin/views/services-page.php; plugin/bb-groomflow/includes/admin/class-packages-list-table.php; plugin/bb-groomflow/includes/admin/views/packages-page.php; plugin/bb-groomflow/includes/admin/class-views-list-table.php; plugin/bb-groomflow/includes/admin/views/views-page.php.
- **Commands executed:** bash scripts/build_plugin_zip.sh; docker compose cp ../build/bb-groomflow-0.1.0-dev.zip wordpress:/var/www/html/bb-groomflow-0.1.0-dev.zip; docker compose run --rm -T wpcli wp plugin install /var/www/html/bb-groomflow-0.1.0-dev.zip --force --activate; qa-phpcs plugin/bb-groomflow; curl -s -b /tmp/wp-cookies.txt "http://localhost:8083/wp-admin/admin.php?page=bbgf-services&s=spa" > /tmp/bbgf-services-search.html; curl -s -b /tmp/wp-cookies.txt "http://localhost:8083/wp-admin/admin.php?page=bbgf-packages&s=day" > /tmp/bbgf-packages-search.html; curl -s -b /tmp/wp-cookies.txt "http://localhost:8083/wp-admin/admin.php?page=bbgf-views&s=day" > /tmp/bbgf-views-search.html; docker compose run --rm -T wpcli wp db query … (insert/delete QA service & package).
- **Tests & results:** `qa-phpcs plugin/bb-groomflow` → clean (`/opt/qa/artifacts/phpcs-1761691639.txt`, `/opt/qa/artifacts/phpcs-1761692397.txt`). Curl pulls confirm the WP_List_Table search boxes render across Services/Packages/Views and filter results correctly (verified with QA seed records, then removed). CRUD data inserted via SQL behaved as expected and cleanup succeeded (`Rows affected: 1` for insert/delete statements).
- **Tips & Tricks:** When building reusable SQL fragments (e.g., `FROM ...` with optional search), prepare the `WHERE` clause first, append it to a shared base string, and reuse that string for both total/count and data queries—keeps pagination maths consistent and avoids double-escaping headaches. For quick QA without full browser automation, seed records with `wp db query`, curl the admin HTML, then delete the rows to leave the DB tidy.
- **Remaining work:** Run the in-browser happy-path (create/edit/delete) to capture visual QA once time allows, then mirror the search treatment to any remaining admin tables if needed before declaring Sprint 1 CRUD complete.
