# Breadcrumb
- **Task asked:** Spin up Sprint 3 Kanban groundwork and outline the implementation plan before coding.
- **Plan:** Review existing placeholder assets and REST payloads → carve Sprint 3 into actionable tasks across PHP bootstrap, JS store/render/polling, interactions, modal, and lobby modes → log the breakdown in the sprint doc and this breadcrumb.
- **Files changed:** docs/sprints/Sprint-3.md
- **Commands executed:** `date +%Y-%m-%d`
- **Tests & results:** Not started (planning-only session).
- **Tips & Tricks:** Board REST payload (`build_board_payload`) already exposes capacity/timer metadata—reuse it when hydrating the front-end store to avoid duplicate transforms.
- **Remaining work:** Execute the listed Sprint 3 tasks starting with the PHP bootstrap that localizes initial board data + REST config into the new JS app.
