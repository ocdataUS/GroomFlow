# Breadcrumb
- **Task asked:** Continue Sprint 1 — deliver services/packages/views CRUD plus global settings and emoji picker polish.
- **Plan:** Implement services admin; build packages admin with service mapping; create views configurator with stage controls; add global settings with localization; enhance flags form; run QA/build/install for verification.
- **Files changed:** plugin/bb-groomflow/includes/admin/class-flags-admin.php; plugin/bb-groomflow/includes/admin/class-services-admin.php; plugin/bb-groomflow/includes/admin/class-packages-admin.php; plugin/bb-groomflow/includes/admin/class-packages-list-table.php; plugin/bb-groomflow/includes/admin/class-services-list-table.php; plugin/bb-groomflow/includes/admin/class-guardians-list-table.php; plugin/bb-groomflow/includes/admin/class-views-admin.php; plugin/bb-groomflow/includes/admin/class-views-list-table.php; plugin/bb-groomflow/includes/admin/class-settings-admin.php; plugin/bb-groomflow/includes/admin/views/clients-page.php; plugin/bb-groomflow/includes/admin/views/guardians-page.php; plugin/bb-groomflow/includes/admin/views/flags-page.php; plugin/bb-groomflow/includes/admin/views/services-page.php; plugin/bb-groomflow/includes/admin/views/packages-page.php; plugin/bb-groomflow/includes/admin/views/views-page.php; plugin/bb-groomflow/includes/admin/views/settings-page.php; plugin/bb-groomflow/assets/js/admin.js; plugin/bb-groomflow/assets/css/admin.css; plugin/bb-groomflow/includes/class-plugin.php; QA_TOOLBELT.md.
- **Commands executed:** `qa-phpcs plugin/bb-groomflow`; `bash scripts/build_plugin_zip.sh`; `docker compose up -d`; `docker compose run --rm -T wpcli wp plugin install /var/www/html/bb-groomflow-0.1.0-dev.zip --force --activate`; `docker compose run --rm -T wpcli wp plugin activate bb-groomflow`.
- **Tests & results:** PHPCS (WordPress standard) — passed (`/opt/qa/artifacts/phpcs-1761232564.txt`); ZIP rebuilt and reinstalled inside Docker WP (success, plugin active).
- **Tips & Tricks:** Avoid running `qa-phpcbf` across multiple files at once — the summary output can overwrite PHP source; run it per-file or lean on manual fixes. Always finish a session by rebuilding the plugin ZIP and reinstalling it in Docker WP so the active environment matches your code before handoff.
- **Remaining work:** Future sprint should extend QA with UI walkthroughs/screenshots once packages/views/settings polished further.
