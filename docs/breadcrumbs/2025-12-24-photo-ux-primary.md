# Breadcrumb
- **Task asked:** Fix photo upload errors, modal spacing/highlighting, add main-photo support, and stabilize board timers/UI.
- **Context:** Completed code changes (frontend + backend) for photo UX, main photo flagging, pending upload list, and modal styling. Docker daemon socket is blocking this shell (`permission denied` on `/var/run/docker.sock`), so ZIP install/QA could not be rerun here.
- **Changes made:** Frontend (`assets/src/index.js`, `style.scss`, built assets) now shows pending filenames with clear/upload controls, prevents lightbox on visibility toggle, adds “Set as main photo” with badges, and polishes tab spacing. Backend (`includes/data/class-visit-service.php`, `includes/api/class-visits-controller.php`) supports `is_primary` on visit photos, auto-sets first photo as primary, and refreshes payload ordering. Built ZIP: `build/bb-groomflow-0.1.0-dev.zip`.
- **Commands attempted:** `npm run build`; `bash scripts/build_plugin_zip.sh`; docker/wpcli calls failed (`permission denied` to daemon socket).
- **Blockers:** Cannot reach Docker daemon from this session (even with alternate DOCKER_HOST); therefore ZIP not reinstalled and PHPCS/functional QA not rerun post-change.
- **Next steps for next agent:** Ensure Docker daemon access, then `cd docker && docker compose up -d` → `docker compose run --rm -T wpcli wp plugin install /var/www/html/bb-groomflow.zip --force --activate` (after copying ZIP) → seed visits if needed → `qa-phpcs plugin/bb-groomflow` → smoke modal photos (upload, set main, toggle visibility) and confirm no errors.***
