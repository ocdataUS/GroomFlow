# Breadcrumb
- **Task asked:** Modal inline-edit + board QA verification (Asana `1212222481217682`)
- **Plan:** Review modal flows against REST payloads, run QA (PHPCS + admin happy-path + modal saves), and fix any regressions before rebuilding/installing the ZIP in Docker.
- **Files changed:** `plugin/bb-groomflow/includes/data/class-visit-service.php`, `docs/REFACTOR_LOG.md`, `qa/QA_LOG.md`, `docs/breadcrumbs/2025-12-02-modal-qa-verification.md`
- **Commands executed:** `git checkout -b refactor/modal-qa-verification`; `npm run build`; `bash scripts/build_plugin_zip.sh`; `docker compose up -d`; `docker compose cp ../build/bb-groomflow-0.1.0-dev.zip wordpress:/var/www/html/bb-groomflow.zip`; `docker compose run --rm -T wpcli wp plugin install /var/www/html/bb-groomflow.zip --force --activate`; `docker compose run --rm -T wpcli wp bbgf visits seed-demo --count=8 --force`; `qa-phpcs plugin/bb-groomflow`; manual admin happy-path via WP-CLI updates; modal notes/services REST save + board snapshot via `wp eval`; `docker compose run --rm -T wpcli wp bbgf visits list --limit=5`.
- **Tests & results:** `qa-phpcs plugin/bb-groomflow` → `/opt/qa/artifacts/phpcs-1764700791.txt` (PASS); Manual admin happy-path (WP-CLI Clients→Settings edits) → `/opt/qa/artifacts/manual-admin-happy-path-20251202T184004.txt` (PASS); Modal notes/services + board snapshot (`wp eval ...`) → `/opt/qa/artifacts/modal-qa-20251202T184049.txt` (PASS; confirms updated_at now set); Board list smoke → `/opt/qa/artifacts/board-list-20251202T184057.txt` (PASS).
- **Tips & Tricks:** `Visit_Service::update_visit()` format order now aligns with the payload so `updated_at` updates correctly; stale board `last_updated` was traced to the `%s`/`%d` mismatch. Modal currently lacks focus trapping/initial focus—consider a follow-up accessibility slice. `docs/DEBT.md` and `docs/ASANA_TOOLBOX.md` remain missing.
- **Remaining work:** Await PM review on Asana `1212222481217682`; open follow-up to add modal focus management/accessibility if prioritized.
