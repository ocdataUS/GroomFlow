# Breadcrumb
- **Task asked:** Prepare Sprint 1 handoff so next agent can resume CRUD and settings work without extra context.
- **Plan:** 1) Summarize current state (data layer + admin screens). 2) List remaining Sprint 1 backlog items. 3) Capture outstanding polish requests (emoji picker, slug automation coverage). 4) Reference latest QA artifacts and install commands.
- **Current status:**
  - Schema installer + seed data in place (`includes/database/class-schema.php`, `BBGF_DB_VERSION`).
  - Admin screens live for Flags (`bbgf-flags`), Clients (`bbgf-clients`), Guardians (`bbgf-guardians`).
  - Slugs now auto-generate server-side; forms hide slug fields.
  - Latest ZIP installed in Docker (`wp plugin install /var/www/html/bb-groomflow-0.1.0-dev.zip --force --activate`).
- **Outstanding work:**
  1. Build CRUD UIs for **Services, Packages, Views** (per Sprint-1 spec) using WP_List_Table + forms.
  2. Implement **global settings page** storing `bbgf_settings` and localize data to JS placeholder board.
  3. Add **emoji picker** to Flags form (per user request) and ensure it is keyboard accessible.
  4. Extend slug auto-generation to any new entities; guard against collisions with `Plugin::unique_slug()`.
  5. Add smoke tests after installs (screenshots of new admin pages + CLI sanity commands); document in breadcrumb when executed.
- **Next QA steps:**
  - `qa-phpcs plugin/bb-groomflow` → see `/opt/qa/artifacts/phpcs-1761175796.txt` (latest clean run).
- After changes: rebuild via `npm run build` + `bash scripts/build_plugin_zip.sh`, reinstall ZIP with WP-CLI, then load admin pages (Clients/Guardians/Flags) to confirm forms submit.
- **Tips & Tricks:** `Plugin::unique_slug()` handles slug collisions; call `$plugin->unique_slug( $name, $tables['services'] )` etc. Emoji picker can live in `assets/js` + `wp_enqueue_script` on admin pages.
- **Remaining work:** Resume Sprint 1 backlog starting with services CRUD, then packages/views/settings. Keep breadcrumbs flowing after every session.
