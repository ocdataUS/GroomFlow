# Breadcrumb
- **Task asked:** Finish Sprint 1 polish on the Views admin so staff can understand stage assignments at a glance and differentiate lobby/internal views.
- **Plan:** 1) Enhance the list table query/output (stage chips, type badges, search parity). 2) Add lightweight styling for new badges/chips. 3) Reinstall the plugin in Docker, reload the Views screen, and verify both existing data and temporary QA inserts behave correctly.
- **Files changed:** plugin/bb-groomflow/includes/admin/class-views-list-table.php; plugin/bb-groomflow/assets/css/admin.css.
- **Commands executed:** `qa-phpcs plugin/bb-groomflow`; `bash scripts/build_plugin_zip.sh`; `docker compose cp ../build/bb-groomflow-0.1.0-dev.zip wordpress:/var/www/html/bb-groomflow-0.1.0-dev.zip`; `docker compose run --rm -T wpcli wp plugin install /var/www/html/bb-groomflow-0.1.0-dev.zip --force --activate`; `curl -s -b /tmp/wp-cookies.txt http://localhost:8083/wp-admin/admin.php?page=bbgf-views`; `docker compose run --rm -T wpcli wp db query …` (create + delete QA lobby view for verification).
- **Tests & results:** `qa-phpcs` clean (`/opt/qa/artifacts/phpcs-1761714413.txt`). HTML snapshot shows stage chips (`<span class="bbgf-chip">`) and type/switcher/guardian badges rendering as expected for existing views. Temporary “QA Lobby View” seeded via SQL, validated badge/chip output, then removed to leave DB tidy.
- **Tips & Tricks:** When enriching list tables with aggregated data, reuse the same `FROM`/`WHERE` fragment for both count and data queries so pagination stays honest. Chips and badges should stay lightweight (no extra JS) to keep WP_List_Table compatible with default bulk actions.
- **Remaining work:** With Services/Packages/Views polished and settings verified, Sprint 1 CRUD is effectively complete—next milestone is Sprint 2 REST scaffolding (intake endpoints, stage move logic). Before jumping ahead, capture in-browser screenshots of each CRUD happy path to satisfy DoD.
