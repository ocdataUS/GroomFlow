# Breadcrumb
- **Task asked:** Finish the stage management split, make the stage removal workflow safe, tighten the views stage selector UX, and update workflow docs per Mike’s testing mandate.
- **Plan:** 1) Audit the new Stages + Views admin implementations against the latest feedback. 2) Apply PHP/JS/CSS updates for clearer helper text, smarter removal warnings, and cleaned stage selection. 3) Rebuild + reinstall the plugin in Docker, run lint/QA checks, and document findings.
- **Files changed:** plugin/bb-groomflow/includes/class-plugin.php; plugin/bb-groomflow/includes/admin/class-stages-admin.php; plugin/bb-groomflow/includes/admin/class-views-admin.php; plugin/bb-groomflow/includes/admin/views/stages-page.php; plugin/bb-groomflow/includes/admin/views/views-page.php; plugin/bb-groomflow/assets/css/admin.css; plugin/bb-groomflow/assets/js/admin.js; docs/workflow.md.
- **Commands executed:** qa-phpcs plugin/bb-groomflow; bash scripts/build_plugin_zip.sh; docker compose up -d; docker compose cp ../build/bb-groomflow-0.1.0-dev.zip wordpress:/var/www/html/bb-groomflow-0.1.0-dev.zip; docker compose run --rm -T wpcli wp plugin install /var/www/html/bb-groomflow-0.1.0-dev.zip --force --activate.
- **Tests & results:** `qa-phpcs` surfaced long-standing warnings/errors outside today’s touch points (documented for follow-up); resolved the fatal (`BBGF\Admin\Stages_Admin` autoload) by adding the missing include, then rebuilt and reinstalled the plugin ZIP in Docker (`wp plugin install … --force --activate` + `wp eval 'class_exists("BBGF\\Admin\\Stages_Admin")' → ok`); after landing the drag/drop + UI updates and the Views persistence adjustments, rebuilt/reinstalled again to confirm the refreshed assets are active in Docker. Migration helpers were removed entirely in this pass so new installs stay client-only. UI smoke still pending—run through Stages + Views in the browser next session to validate the new tooltips, coloured timer outlines, drag-and-drop ordering, and single-save workflow.
- **Tips & Tricks:** Populate `data-stage-usage` with newline-separated bullet text so the JS confirm reads cleanly—`implode("\n - ", ...)` keeps the modal readable; when wiring drag handles without extra deps, make the handle the draggable element and rely on `event.submitter` inside the form submit hook so delete buttons don’t inherit the bulk-save action; remember to add matching `screen-reader-text` helpers whenever you aim `aria-describedby` at inline groups so tooltips stay accessible.
- **Remaining work:** Browser-verify Stages + Views admin (confirm the new callout, helper tooltips, coloured timer borders, drag-and-drop ordering, and stage removal fallback messaging) and capture QA screenshots; address the backlog of PHPCS findings the toolbelt report highlighted once the broader refactor lands.
