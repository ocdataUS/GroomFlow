# Breadcrumb
- **Task asked:** Finish Sprint 3 by packaging the plugin and running the QA loop before visual testing.
- **Plan:** Final `npm run build` → create ZIP via `scripts/build_plugin_zip.sh` → install into Docker WP with WP-CLI → run PHPCS through the QA toolbelt → document the path for manual testing + remaining checks.
- **Files changed:** *(none — packaging/QA only)*
- **Commands executed:**
  - `npm run build`
  - `bash scripts/build_plugin_zip.sh`
  - `cd docker && docker compose up -d`
  - `cd docker && docker compose run --rm -T wpcli wp plugin install bb-groomflow-0.1.0-dev.zip --force --activate`
  - `cd docker && docker compose down`
  - `qa-phpcs plugin/bb-groomflow` (host run for final lint check)
- **Tests & results:** PHPCS clean apart from expected capability/schema warnings (`/opt/qa/artifacts/phpcs-1761932499.txt`). Plugin ZIP installed successfully inside Docker (`build/bb-groomflow-0.1.0-dev.zip`).
- **Tips & Tricks:** When reinstalling, run `docker compose run --rm -T wpcli wp plugin install bb-groomflow-0.1.0-dev.zip --force --activate` from `docker/`; the ZIP is already copied into the container’s working dir. Use `window.bbgfBoardStore.getState()` in the browser console to inspect filters/pending moves during UI tests.
- **Remaining work:** Visual smoke test in Docker WP (board interactions, modal editing, lobby fullscreen) + manual happy-path per QA toolbelt, then prep handoff summary.
