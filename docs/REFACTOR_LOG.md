# REFACTOR_LOG — Slice Ledger

Record every slice here. Keep entries chronological (newest on top). Use the template below:

| Date | Agent | Branch | Slice | Status | Plan / Scope | QA & Artifacts | Notes / Next Steps |
| 2025-11-09 | maint | dev | S7 · Board Polling & REST Wiring | Completed | Render the admin/shortcode/Elementor board with live payloads (no more placeholder shell) by reusing localized settings, converting visit payloads into the PHP preview renderer, and ensuring the JS bundle receives the same context. Verified REST output via WP-CLI. | `qa-phpcs plugin/bb-groomflow` → `/opt/qa/artifacts/phpcs-1762671186.txt`; Board payload snapshot (`wp eval …`) → `/opt/qa/artifacts/board-payload-20251109T005409.json`; `bash scripts/build_plugin_zip.sh` + Docker install (`docker compose cp …`, `docker compose run --rm -T wpcli wp plugin install … --force --activate`); `docker compose run --rm -T wpcli wp bbgf visits seed-demo --count=8 --force`. | Board markup now mirrors real visits/capacity data on first paint; front-end continues to poll/move stages via REST. |
| 2025-11-09 | maint | dev | Baseline cleanup & S7 planning | Completed | Merge `refactor/s6-board-localization` into `dev`, rebuild/install the ZIP, reseed demo data, re-run PHPCS, and document the next actionable slice so the sentinel can continue. | `bash scripts/build_plugin_zip.sh`; `docker compose cp ../build/bb-groomflow-0.1.0-dev.zip … && docker compose run --rm -T wpcli wp plugin install … --force --activate`; `docker compose run --rm -T wpcli wp bbgf visits seed-demo --count=8 --force`; `qa-phpcs plugin/bb-groomflow` → `/opt/qa/artifacts/phpcs-1762669738.txt`. | Repo is clean on `dev` with slices S1–S6 merged; S7 (Board Polling & REST Wiring) is ready for the next agent. |
| 2025-11-09 | codex | (pending) refactor/s7-next-slice | S7 · Next Slice Intake | Blocked | Attempted to start the next slice after reading the full stack, but `PROJECT_PLAN.md` has no unclaimed slices and the repo is still on `refactor/s6-board-localization` with uncommitted files from the prior agent. Cannot branch from `dev` or scope work until the Product Owner defines the next slice and confirms how to handle the existing changes. | None — blocked before coding or QA. | Need direction on the next slice plus a clean baseline (merge/clean existing branch or advise to continue it). Once scope is clarified and the tree is clean, we can branch and log the slice properly. |
| 2025-11-09 | codex | refactor/s6-board-localization | S6 · Board Localization & Placeholder Accessibility | Completed | Studied `plugin/bb-groomflow/includes/bootstrap/class-assets-service.php` (asset registration, board payload localization, placeholder renderer), `plugin/bb-groomflow/includes/class-plugin.php` service wiring, `plugin/bb-groomflow/includes/bootstrap/class-admin-menu-service.php`, and `plugin/bb-groomflow/includes/elementor/class-board-widget.php` consumers. Added `wp_set_script_translations()` + new `bbgf_board_script_settings` / `bbgf_placeholder_board_data` filters, refreshed placeholder markup with region/timer labels + readable service chips, and kept wrappers (`bbgf()->get_placeholder_board_markup()`, Elementor widget, admin preview) untouched. | `bash scripts/build_plugin_zip.sh`; Docker install (`docker compose cp …`, `docker compose run --rm -T wpcli wp plugin install … --force --activate`); `docker compose run --rm -T wpcli wp bbgf visits seed-demo --count=8 --force`; `qa-phpcs plugin/bb-groomflow` → `/opt/qa/artifacts/phpcs-1762668016.txt`; Manual admin happy-path (WP-CLI Clients→Settings checklist) → `/opt/qa/artifacts/manual-admin-happy-path-20251109T060122-s6.txt`. | Placeholder board across shortcode/admin/Elementor now exposes ARIA-friendly labels and timer narration so kiosk/lobby previews read correctly; filters unblock future customization without touching core assets. |
| 2025-11-08 | codex | refactor/s5-docs-qa | S5 · Documentation & QA Enforcement | Completed | Refreshed README, SPEC, TECH_READINESS, and QA_TOOLBELT so the slice ritual (read stack → branch/log → build ZIP → Docker install → QA + artifacts) is explicit. Documented the new bootstrap services, uninstall/CLI safeguards, and a headless manual-admin template. | `bash scripts/build_plugin_zip.sh` + Docker install (`docker compose cp …`, `wp plugin install … --force --activate`); `qa-phpcs plugin/bb-groomflow` → `/opt/qa/artifacts/phpcs-1762667282.txt`; Manual admin happy-path (WP-CLI proxy for Clients→Settings) → `/opt/qa/artifacts/manual-admin-happy-path-20251109T054819-s5.txt`. | README/SPEC now mirror the modular bootstrap + QA expectations; TECH_READINESS/QA_TOOLBELT include a reusable CLI checklist for manual admin verification. |
| 2025-11-08 | codex | refactor/s4-cli-hardening | S4 · CLI & Seed Data Hardening | Completed | Hardened the visits WP-CLI (`plugin/bb-groomflow/includes/cli/class-visits-command.php`) with prepared statements, forced truncation safeguards, per-view logging, and seed payloads that pass explicit `created_at`/timer values into `Visit_Service::create_visit()`. Added timestamp normalization in `plugin/bb-groomflow/includes/data/class-visit-service.php`, refreshed workflow/docs/plan/history/notes/changelog, and captured a breadcrumb + QA log. | `qa-phpcs plugin/bb-groomflow` → `/opt/qa/artifacts/phpcs-1762666565.txt`; `wp bbgf visits seed-demo --count=4 --force` → `/opt/qa/artifacts/seed-demo-20251108233016.txt`; Manual admin happy-path (Clients→Settings create/edit via wp-cli table updates) → `/opt/qa/artifacts/manual-admin-happy-path-20251108-s4.txt`; ZIP rebuilt + reinstalled before QA. | Per-view seed logs now highlight missing stages/services immediately and demo visits respect realistic check-in timers; UI verification still recommended in a browser since this run relied on wp-cli to mutate records. |
| 2025-11-08 | codex | refactor/s3-plugin-modularization | S3 · Plugin Bootstrap Modularization | Completed | Extracted new `BBGF\Bootstrap` services for assets/Elementor, admin menu shell, REST routing, and WP-CLI registration, then slimmed `Plugin` down to instantiating those services with wrapper methods for `bootstrap_elementor()` + placeholder markup. Added autoload requires and ensured visit/notification/admin helpers still resolve through the plugin. | `qa-phpcs plugin/bb-groomflow` → `/opt/qa/artifacts/phpcs-1762665491.txt`; Manual admin happy-path (Clients→Settings create/edit + dashboard shell) → `/opt/qa/artifacts/manual-admin-happy-path-20251108-s3.txt`; ZIP rebuilt + installed via Docker (`bash scripts/build_plugin_zip.sh`, `docker compose cp …`, `wp plugin install … --force --activate`) and demo data reseeded. | New services live in `plugin/bb-groomflow/includes/bootstrap/`; future slices can extend them instead of expanding `Plugin`. Elementor + shortcode consumers keep calling `bbgf()->bootstrap_elementor()` / `get_placeholder_board_markup()` which now proxy to the assets service. |
| 2025-11-08 | codex | refactor/s2-uninstall-cleanup | S2 · Uninstall & Data Cleanup | Completed | Replaced the uninstall stub with a multi-site aware cleanup that traverses every blog, drops all GroomFlow tables defined in `Schema::TABLE_MAP`, and deletes every `bbgf_*` option/site option. Added the `BBGF_PRESERVE_DATA_ON_UNINSTALL` constant + `bbgf_allow_uninstall_cleanup` filter, refreshed docs, and recorded the new safeguards. | `qa-phpcs plugin/bb-groomflow` → `/opt/qa/artifacts/phpcs-1762654708.txt`; Manual admin happy-path (Clients→Settings create/edit) → `/opt/qa/artifacts/manual-admin-happy-path-20251108-s2.txt`; `bash scripts/build_plugin_zip.sh` + Docker `compose cp`/`wp plugin install … --force --activate` + `wp bbgf visits seed-demo --count=8 --force`. | Define the preserve-data constant or filter before uninstalling if QA needs to keep fixtures; next slice can build on the clean uninstall baseline. |
| 2025-11-08 | codex | refactor/s1-phpcs-remediation | S1 · PHPCS & Coding Standards | Completed | Normalized WPCS issues across plugin bootstrap, CLI seeders, visit data service, and notifications service. Replaced blanket suppressions with targeted fixes (dbDelta-driven schema upgrade, sanitized wp_rand/timestamps, explicit docblocks, aligned arrays) while keeping APIs stable for admin/REST/CLI consumers. | `qa-phpcs plugin/bb-groomflow` → `/opt/qa/artifacts/phpcs-1762654083.txt`; Manual admin happy-path (Clients→Settings create/edit) → `/opt/qa/artifacts/manual-admin-happy-path-20251108.txt`; ZIP rebuilt + installed via Docker (`bash scripts/build_plugin_zip.sh`, docker compose cp/install) and demo data reseeded. | CLI `wp bbgf visits seed-demo --count=8 --force` verified after reinstall; schema upgrades now re-use `dbDelta` so future columns follow the same path. |
| 2025-11-08 | onboarding | refactor/docs-onboarding | Sentinel Prep | Completed | Create PROMPT/PROJECT_PLAN/TECH_READINESS, HISTORY/NOTES/REFACTOR_LOG, QA log scaffolding, update AGENTS. | `qa-phpcs plugin/bb-groomflow` → `/opt/qa/artifacts/phpcs-bbgf-20251108T174330.txt`; Docker install logs in breadcrumb `docs/breadcrumbs/2025-11-08-compliance-audit.md`. | Statless agent framework ready; next slice S1 (PHPCS remediation). |

Statuses must be one of: **In Progress**, **Completed**, **Blocked**. When you start a slice, add a new row marked “In Progress.” When you finish or block, update the same row instead of creating a new one.
