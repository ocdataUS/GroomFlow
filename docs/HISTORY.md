# HISTORY — GroomFlow Refactor Timeline

| Date | Slice / Topic | Summary | QA Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2025-11-09 | Baseline cleanup & S7 planning | Merged `refactor/s6-board-localization` into `dev`, rebuilt/installed the ZIP, reseeded demo data, re-ran PHPCS, and documented slice S7 (Board Polling & REST Wiring) so the next sentinel can branch cleanly. | `bash scripts/build_plugin_zip.sh`; `docker compose cp ../build/bb-groomflow-0.1.0-dev.zip … && docker compose run --rm -T wpcli wp plugin install … --force --activate`; `docker compose run --rm -T wpcli wp bbgf visits seed-demo --count=8 --force`; `qa-phpcs plugin/bb-groomflow` → `/opt/qa/artifacts/phpcs-1762669738.txt`. |
| 2025-11-09 | S6 · Board Localization & Placeholder Accessibility | Assets service now registers translation files for the board bundle, exposes filters for front-end payloads/placeholder datasets, and refreshes the placeholder markup with region labels, live column counts, timer narration, and non-hidden service chips so screen readers announce the preview accurately across the shortcode, admin, and Elementor surfaces. | `qa-phpcs plugin/bb-groomflow` → `/opt/qa/artifacts/phpcs-1762668016.txt`; Manual admin happy-path (WP-CLI checklist for Clients→Settings) → `/opt/qa/artifacts/manual-admin-happy-path-20251109T060122-s6.txt`; ZIP rebuilt + reinstalled via Docker prior to QA. |
| 2025-11-08 | S5 · Documentation & QA Enforcement | Updated README, SPEC, TECH_READINESS, and QA_TOOLBELT to spell out the stateless slice ritual (read stack → branch/log → build/install ZIP → qa-phpcs + manual admin) and documented the modular bootstrap services, uninstall safeguards, and headless WP-CLI checklist for manual QA. | `qa-phpcs plugin/bb-groomflow` → `/opt/qa/artifacts/phpcs-1762667282.txt`; Manual admin happy-path (WP-CLI proxy for Clients→Settings) → `/opt/qa/artifacts/manual-admin-happy-path-20251109T054819-s5.txt`; ZIP rebuilt + reinstalled in Docker before QA. |
| 2025-11-08 | S4 · CLI & Seed Data Hardening | Hardened `wp bbgf visits` commands with prepared statements, per-view logging, and explicit timestamp handling; `Visit_Service::create_visit()` now honors provided timer data so demo visits age realistically; workflow/docs updated with the new `seed-demo` expectations. | `qa-phpcs plugin/bb-groomflow` → `/opt/qa/artifacts/phpcs-1762666565.txt`; `wp bbgf visits seed-demo --count=4 --force` → `/opt/qa/artifacts/seed-demo-20251108233016.txt`; Manual admin happy-path (simulated via wp-cli SQL edits for Clients→Settings) → `/opt/qa/artifacts/manual-admin-happy-path-20251108-s4.txt`. |
| 2025-11-08 | S3 · Plugin Bootstrap Modularization | Split the legacy bootstrap into dedicated services for assets/Elementor, admin navigation, REST controllers, and WP-CLI wiring. `Plugin` now instantiates those services, exposing wrappers for `bootstrap_elementor()` + placeholder markup so external consumers stay stable. | `qa-phpcs plugin/bb-groomflow` → `/opt/qa/artifacts/phpcs-1762665491.txt`; Manual admin happy-path (Clients→Settings create/edit + dashboard shell) → `/opt/qa/artifacts/manual-admin-happy-path-20251108-s3.txt`. |
| 2025-11-08 | S2 · Uninstall & Data Cleanup | Replaced the stub uninstall hook with a guarded cleanup routine that loops every site, drops all schema tables via `Schema::TABLE_MAP`, purges `bbgf_*` options (including network sitemeta), and honors the new `BBGF_PRESERVE_DATA_ON_UNINSTALL` constant + `bbgf_allow_uninstall_cleanup` filter. Documented the safeguard and refreshed status docs. | `qa-phpcs plugin/bb-groomflow` → `/opt/qa/artifacts/phpcs-1762654708.txt`; Manual admin happy-path (Clients→Settings) → `/opt/qa/artifacts/manual-admin-happy-path-20251108-s2.txt`; rebuilt + reinstalled ZIP in Docker before QA. |
| 2025-11-08 | S1 · PHPCS & Coding Standards | Removed blanket PHPCS suppressions by refactoring schema upgrades to `dbDelta`, documenting board visibility helpers, and aligning CLI/data/notification services with WPCS (prepared queries, wp_rand/timestamps, array alignment). Rebuilt + redeployed the plugin ZIP into Docker afterwards. | `qa-phpcs plugin/bb-groomflow` → `/opt/qa/artifacts/phpcs-1762654083.txt`; manual admin happy-path log → `/opt/qa/artifacts/manual-admin-happy-path-20251108.txt`; ZIP installed via Docker wpcli + demo reseed noted in breadcrumb. |
| 2025-11-08 | Compliance Audit & Sentinel Prep | Reviewed full plugin for WP coding-standard compliance, rebuilt ZIP, installed in Docker, seeded demo data, added stateless-agent playbook (AGENTS/PROMPT/PROJECT_PLAN/etc.). | `qa-phpcs plugin/bb-groomflow` → `/opt/qa/artifacts/phpcs-bbgf-20251108T174330.txt`; Docker install logs in breadcrumb `docs/breadcrumbs/2025-11-08-compliance-audit.md`. |
