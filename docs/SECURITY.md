# Security & Access

## Scope
- **Lives here:** Capability/nonce rules, public token handling, sanitization/escaping reminders.
- **Not here:** Full API list, QA steps, or architecture maps (see `AGENTS.md` map).

Caps per SPEC; write routes require X‑WP‑Nonce + caps; sanitize allowlisted stages; escape outputs; public boards via tokens.
