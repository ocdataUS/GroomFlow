# Changelog
## [Unreleased]
- Implement guarded uninstall cleanup that drops all GroomFlow tables, removes every `bbgf_*` option/site option, and exposes `BBGF_PRESERVE_DATA_ON_UNINSTALL` + `bbgf_allow_uninstall_cleanup` for retention scenarios.
- Refine `/bb-groomflow/v1/board` response with ordered stage metadata, visibility mask flags, and lobby/public data scrubbing.
- Introduce `wp bbgf` WP-CLI stubs for visits inspection and production snapshot preparation.
- Add `/stats/daily` and `/stats/stage-averages` REST endpoints for reporting dashboards.
- Add `/stats/service-mix` endpoint delivering service/package usage statistics.
- Scaffold stage-triggered notifications with `bbgf_visit_stage_changed` and `bbgf_notification_stage_queued` hooks tied into visit moves.
- Persist notification deliveries to `wp_bb_notification_logs` with status metadata (stage, recipients, send outcome), add Notification Activity filters (search/date range/stage/status/template), and surface CSV export + resend controls.
- Sprint 0 enhancements: register roles/capabilities, build the admin menu shell, and render the interactive placeholder Kanban board/shortcode.
- Add Vite-driven asset pipeline (`npm run build`) plus Elementor widget skeleton wired to the preview board.
- Introduce `bb-groomflow/v1` namespace with `/health` endpoint and document the delivery flow (README + workflow updates).
- Establish database schema scaffolding with `BBGF_DB_VERSION`, install/upgrade helpers, and seed starter data for services, flags, and the default view.
- Add WordPress admin UI for behavior flags with CRUD actions, nonce protection, and WP_List_Table rendering.
- Modularize plugin bootstrap by moving board assets, admin shell, REST routing, and WP-CLI registration into dedicated services with stable wrappers for Elementor + placeholder markup.
- Teach the board assets service to load translation files, expose `bbgf_board_script_settings`/`bbgf_placeholder_board_data` filters, and refresh the placeholder markup with ARIA labels/timer narration so shortcode, admin, and Elementor previews stay accessible.
- Harden coding standards across bootstrap/CLI/data/notification services (dbDelta-based upgrade for notification triggers, wp_rand-based demo data, documented visibility helpers) so `qa-phpcs plugin/bb-groomflow` runs clean without blanket ignores.
- Harden `wp bbgf visits` CLI + demo seed data (prepared statements, per-view logging, UTC-friendly timestamps) and teach `Visit_Service::create_visit()` to honor supplied timer metadata so seeded visits immediately reflect elapsed time and status.
- Ship Clients & Guardians admin dashboards with create/update/delete flows, guardian linkage, and sortable lists.
- Standardize all naming and settings on the `client` terminology (no legacy dog schema remains).
- Expose `/clients` REST endpoints with search/pagination and tighten admin package validation to honor selected services reliably.
- Expand the emoji picker catalog with additional species/status icons and sync selected services to the server via hidden field fallback.
- Bootstrap WordPress plugin scaffold with activation hooks, shortcode placeholder, and admin shell.
- Add manual build tooling (`scripts/build_plugin_zip.sh`) and PHPCS ruleset.
- Provision Docker WordPress stack, production-sync loader script, and workflow documentation for stateless agents.
- Expand product specification, roadmap, sprint plans, and architecture docs to support feature planning.
- Documented the stateless slice ritual across README/SPEC/TECH_READINESS/QA_TOOLBELT (build ZIP → Docker install → qa-phpcs + manual admin) and published a WP-CLI happy-path template for headless QA evidence.
- Document change-management process (AGENTS.md + `docs/CHANGE_MANAGEMENT.md`) so agents can collaborate on pivots safely.
